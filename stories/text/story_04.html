The Story of the Levee war began when the first settlers settled down in (todays) New Orleans and quickly began to built levees around their new born city. The first levee along the Mississippi  River was built between 1718 and 1727 and consisted of a slightly more than a mile-long, 4 feet high earthen mound, 18 feet wide at the top with a road along the crown.<br>
The first devastating hurricane occurred in 1722, with a storm surge of 7 to 8 feet and ripped the levee apart. afterwards, a continual uprising of the levees each time a flood overflew their protections was established. It wasn’t until the first  federal flood control act in 1917 that they began to recognize that their levee only policy primary used for navigation and not protection was designated to fail but they continued to adopt the previous flood as design flow line for future levees because of the river avulsion, a consequence from the construction of the uprising of the previously constructed levees. <br>
The year 1927 came, and with it the greatest, most destructive flood in recorded history along the lower Mississippi River Valley. The stage was set with heavier-than- normal rains in the summer of 1926, followed by intense winter storms and heavy rains in early 1927 that continued through the spring and early summer. <br>
Ninety-four percent of more than 630,000 people affected by the flood lived in the states of Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana, most in the Mississippi Delta. The uninflated cost of the damage has been estimated to be between 246 million and 1 billion dollars and more than 200,000 African Americans were displaced from their homes along the Lower Mississippi River and had to live for lengthy periods in relief camps. <br>
Some areas along the route of destruction saw the river escape its natural and man-made confines and spread 50 miles wide. Below Memphis, Tennessee, the width of the river was around 60 miles. <br>
To prevent future floods, the federal government built the world’s longest system of levees and floodways and quickly responded with the 1928 Flood Control Act and the legislation to do so. <br>
Some of these floodways were quite large, such as the Birds Point-New Madrid in Missouri, which is about 35 miles long, 3 to 10 miles wide and designed to divert 550,000 cubic feet per second of flow from the Mississippi during floods. <br>
Further downriver, the West Atchafalaya Floodway was envisioned to carry half of the modelled projected flood of 1,500,000 cubic feet (139,400 m³) per second. Upriver from New Orleans is the Bonnet Carré Floodway. Its purpose is to restrict the flow to downstream by diverting the water and protecting homes and businesses of more than 1.1 million people of the Greater New Orleans area. <br>
When the 1973 flood hit the Mississippi River basin, it was one of the highest floods recorded in 200 years. It brought  about the realization that building levees and other flood control measures actually decrease the carrying capacity of the river, so that the flood levels will always be higher than before the levees were built . <br>
At Memphis, Tennessee  the Mississippi was over flood stage for 63 days, and the river was above flood stage for an even longer 107 days at upstream Cairo, Illinois.<br>
The flooding in 1993 showed again, that the new system failed enormously. Due to the constriction of the river, caused by levees, several cases of structural failure, overtopping, crevasse splays, collapse and immense amounts of damage has been recorded. On the Mississippi, Grafton, Illinois, recorded flooding for 195 days. Approximately two-thirds of all the levees in the Upper Mississippi River Basin collapsed or were breached or otherwise damaged. <br>
The Upper Mississippi River Basin experienced record or near-record floods in June of 2008 rupturing at least 25 levees in Missouri, Iowa and Illinois .<br>
Numerous failures and overtopping of levees near Winfield, Missouri, worked to spread the water across the floodplain, lowering the crest to below record levels, before the flood reached the confluence with the Missouri River.<br>
The flood of 2011, which was the worst on record since 1927 illustrated that the vulnerability and todays situation, even with all the control measures, have not reduced the threat of flooding along the system.  It was the first time, all the three flood control spillways needed to be open simultaneously, to remove water from the river. This example indicates how the system can protect from flooding for low-magnitude events, but with climate change and more frequent events, the river cannot be tamed or controlled. The levee system must be breached, to move the waters back to designated areas, to protect other areas deemed more valuable by the US Army Corps of Engineers and other government authorities.<br>
