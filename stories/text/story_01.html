In the 1970’s a new kind of fish was introduced to the U.S  to control algae, weed and parasite grow from aquatic farms and weeds in canal systems. The bighead carp, black carp, grass carp and silver carp, collectively known as ‚asian carp‘, used to regulate the river and its outcome.<br>
But these new carp invaders, however, are causing their own brand of trouble in the Mississippi River and its lakes within the riverside because they eventually escaped into it and established breeding populations. The carp are slowly making their way up the River and its tributaries, causing a serious damage to the native fish populations, out-competing other fish for food and space. 
They also thought to lower water quality and they can jump over some barries, including low dams.<br>
But there are two last strong defenses against these northward moving fish. 
The first one is Lock and Dam No. 1, 36 feet tall, so the only way carp can pass  through them is to swim through the locks when they open to pass a boat. 
The distance between the water levels above and below the dam is far enough, so the carp can’t jump over it, hopefully even during floods.  So minimizing the use of these locks and dams will limit the ability of the carp to travel farther on the Mississippi. <br>

Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dams is the second defense that’s high enough to stop the carp movement. But if its left unchecked, if this kind of problem does not reach enough minds the asian carp may find their ways into lakes such as Itasca, Bemidji and other Mississippi River tributaries.
