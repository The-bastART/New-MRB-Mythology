In the 1970s a new kind of fish was introduced to the U.S  to control algae, weed and parasite grow from aquatic farms and weeds in canal systems. The bighead carp, black carp, grass carp and silver carp, collectively known as ‚asian carp‘, were used to regulate the river and its outcome. <br>
But these carp invaders, however, are causing their own kind of trouble in the Mississippi River and its lakes within the riverside because they eventually escaped into it and established breeding populations. The carp are slowly making their way up the River and its tributaries, causing a serious damage to the native fish populations, out-competing other fish for food and space. <br>
They also thought to lower water quality and they can jump over some barries, including low dams.<br>
But there are two last strong defenses against these northward moving fish. <br>
The first one is Lock and Dam No. 1, 36 feet tall, so the only way carp can pass  through them is to swim through the locks when they open to pass a boat. <br>
The distance between the water levels above and below the dam is far enough, so the carp can’t jump over it, hopefully even during floods.  So minimizing the use of these locks and dams will limit the ability of the carp to travel farther on the Mississippi. <br>

Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dams is the second defense that’s high enough to stop the carp movement. But if it's left unchecked, if this kind of problem does not reach enough minds the asian carp may find their ways into lakes such as Itasca, Bemidji and other Mississippi River tributaries.<br>
But the story about the carps in general, begun much earlier, with the common carp native to parts of Europe and Asia being brought to Greece, England and Austria mostly exclusively for the use of the royalty. Nobility and clergy demanded meals of carp. The fish were held in ponds in the cellars of monasteries, where they were fattened and  bread until killed for the table. <br>
Thus carp became food of the bourgeoisie and anyone who emigrated to the new world had developed a taste for the rich fish. So it was only a matter of time, until the first request to the government was made, demanding carp to be brought to the table. The requests exploded. By 1880, the commission was getting 2,000 letters a year because the rapidly growing industrial society might soon run out of fish reserves. Although the commission members knew the nation’s native fisheries were being ruined by human development, it would've been politically unwise to recommend that the pollution, over-fishing, wetland drainage, and logging were responsible for this. Instead, the federal government decided to find a new fish species that could replace or at least supplement those dying out. In 1877, the commission imported 345 common, mirror, and leather carp and placed them in ponds around Baltimore. The next year, some of these fish were transferred to ponds near the capitol in Washington D.C., where they soon had produced over 6,000 carp fingerlings that were shipped to 273 applicants in 24 states.<br>
The spread of carp in North America had begun.<br>
So the question I would like to ask you is not only how we can stop invasive fish species to ruin our fragile ecosystem. It is more about our definition of invasive. How we decide that the common carp, primarily used for the satisfaction of our bourgeois demands, is a useful tool and the asian carp, brought to the U.S. to clear the commercial ponds is seen as an invasive thread? Is it not always mankind, that decides how to improve previously mistakes? How to make things more suitable for society and when it comes to dealing with mistakes, how to erase what had been done? They talk about eating the river free. To put the asian carp into a taco, between two buns, to stop the increasing invasion. <br>
Maybe its time to think before we act again. To learn from our mistakes, rather than do it over and over again. To stop solving problems like we used to and to, please, stop importing and establishing foreign species into our ecosystems.<br>
