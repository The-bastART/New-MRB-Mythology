Over the past hundred years flooding of the Mississippi has gotten worse and worse. On the one hand this is due to our global climate crisis and the following increase of extreme weather conditions like hurricanes. But on the other it started earlier than the first effects of this crisis with the infrastructuralization of the Mississippi and the misconception that nature is controllable.<br>
After every flood higher levees were constructed and the river had less chance to escape onto its natural flood plains. This increased the water levels during extreme weather events which in turn generated the need to build even higher infrastructure for protection. You can see where this is going. That's the reason why the term <i>Infra-Natural Disaster</i> was coined because this conflict is not single-sided but an interaction of systems.<br><br>
You can explore the water levels from New Madrid downstream to New Orleans from 2000 to 2020 in the interactive graphic below. Just hover your cursor over a line graph and click to get to the next water level gage downstream.<br><br>
