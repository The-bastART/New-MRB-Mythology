The Missouri River joins the Mississippi at <span id="story_marker_1"></span><span style="color: #7A6FDE">St. Louis</span>, forming the world’s 
fourth longest river system. In 2015, a pipeline burst and spilled about 3 
million gallons of saltwater waste into the Missouri River. What is known 
as one of the worst environmental disasters in North Dakota had direct 
impacts on the whole Missouri and Mississippi river system. The oil and 
gas industry is using fracking all over the Bakken formation. In North 
Dakota, an average of two gallons of wastewater per minute are spilled. 
We decided to take a closer look at Western North Dakota to visualize the 
harmful relationship between industrial projects and the environment 
where humans and non-humans live.<br>
