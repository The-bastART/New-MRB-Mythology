Nothing here is real.<br>
This is not a river.<br>
But still it is everything.<br><br>
The human intervention to control the river to their needs has left scars of depremental order.
The river was cut off to shorten it. Dams were built to create water supply, electricity and aid navigation. 
Large portions of the banks were reinforced with concrete mats to stop further meandering, the river's natural behaviour.
Levees are restricting its freedom to flow but the river bed was deepend to accomodate the flow of capital.<br>
This change of purpose requires a change of perception. One to lay bare the structure of deception.
This is not a river but one of the largest invasive engineering projects in the world.<br>
What we see is not really there. <br>
What is there we don't really see.

Here I'm floating on the water<br>
I was standing in the wet<br>
When my breath is getting shorter<br>
My head rests on a concrete bed<br><br>
